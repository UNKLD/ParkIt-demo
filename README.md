### Folder Structure
Here is the core folder structure which flutter provides.

```
flutter-app/
|- android
|- build
|- ios
|- lib
|- test
```

Here is the folder structure we have been using in this project

```
lib/
|- constants/
|- screens/
|- main.dart
```

Now, lets dive into the lib folder which has the main code for the application.

```
1- constants - All the application level constants are defined in this directory with-in their respective files. This directory contains the constants for `theme`, `dimentions`, `api endpoints`, `preferences` and `strings`.
4- screens‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains all the ui of this project for each screen.
6- constants‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäContains the common widgets for your applications. For example, Button, TextField etc.
8- main.dart - This is the starting point of the application. Which contains the routes and all the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.
```

### Constants

This directory contains all the application level constants. A separate file is created for each type as shown in example below:

```
constants/
|- constants.dart
```



### UI

This directory contains all the ui of your application. Each screen is located in a single folder.

```
lib/
|- screens
   |- welcomeScreen.dart
   |- loginScreen.dart
   |- registerScreen.dart
   |- reserveScreen.dart
   |- ...
```


### Widgets

Contains the common widgets that are shared across multiple screens. For example, Button, TextField etc.

```
components/
|- dynamicDialog.dart
|- progressDialog.dart
|- roundedButton.dart
```


### Main

This is the starting point of the application. All the application level configurations are defined in this file i.e, theme, routes, title, orientation etc.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:untitled/screens/About.dart';
import 'package:untitled/screens/FeedBack.dart';
import 'package:untitled/screens/NearBy.dart';
import 'package:untitled/screens/Profile.dart';

import 'package:untitled/screens/unParkCarScreen.dart';
import 'package:untitled/screens/verifyScreen.dart';
import 'package:untitled/screens/welcomeScreen.dart';
import 'package:firebase_core/firebase_core.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Firebase.initializeApp();
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'ParkIT',
      theme: ThemeData(
        visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity,
      ),
      initialRoute: WelcomeScreen.id,
      routes: {
        WelcomeScreen.id: (context) => WelcomeScreen(),
        MainScreen.id: (context) => MainScreen(),
        LoginScreen.id: (context) => LoginScreen(),
        RegisterScreen.id: (context) => RegisterScreen(),
        VerifyScreen.id: (context) => VerifyScreen(),
        ScanPage.id: (context) => ScanPage(),
        FeedBack.id: (context) => FeedBack(),
        ParkCarScreen.id: (context) => ParkCarScreen(),
        UnParkCarScreen.id: (context) => UnParkCarScreen(),
        About.id: (context) => About(),
